    <b>How the Web Works</b>
</p>

The web is a network of computers. Using <b><em>HTTP</b></em> (hyper text transfer protocol) to communcate with each other. When a request from a user is requested the servers finds the right
<b>HTML</b> (Hypertext Markup Language) doc to send back then a web browser interprets the page and displays it. Unless your using internet exploder then it will just explode on you for no reason. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBI9kXzMHS0">This</a> gives a good overview.

  <b>HTML</b></br>
</p>

HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language. HTML documents contain text content which describes "what you see" and markup which describes "how it looks". HTML is pretty straight forward and is the majority of documents on the internet. <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer/#!/c-nd000/l-3873828673/m-48724340">This</a> gives a good overview.

  <b>Tags and Elements</b>
  <br>
  <br> HTML documents are made of HTML elements. When writing HTML, we tell browsers the type of each element by using HTML tags. So on this page I made the "tags and Elements" bold above by putting beginning and ending tags to tell the webpage what to do.

  <br> Computers are only as good as there programming.

  <b>Inline vs Block Elements</B><br>
  <br>
  HTML elements are either inline or block. Block elements form an "invisible box" around the content inside of them. Some examples of <em>inline elements</em> are: a, span, br, img, strong. Examples of <em>block elements</em> are: div,  form, and p. <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer/#!/c-nd000/l-3873828673/m-48723438">This</a> gives a good overview.
